<p class="usa-font-lead">Innovation and creativity is a messy process and is not the same every time. Innovations can be small an impactful, and systemic change is long and slow. To customize innovative methodologies to meet your own needs, be deliberate about the kinds of innovations you want to do. Learn from others, but forge your own path.

  <li>Which methodologies are best suited to the type of innovation you are pursuing?</li>
  <li>Can you improve upon existing methodologies?</li>
  <li>Can you share those improvements more widely to facilitate greater innovation elsewhere in government?</li>
  <li>What lessons have you learned from innovating?</li>
  <li>How can your approach be refined to reflect those lessons?</li>

<h2 id="section-heading-h2">Questions to Ask</h2>
    <li>How are you defining success (and failure) at the beginning of the project?</li>
    <li>Which data points are indicative of overall success? Failure?</li>
    <li>Are changes to the data the result of innovation? Or external factors?</li>
    <li>What are the benefits and costs of the evidenced changes?</li>
    <li>Do the changes evidence success or failure? Tell the story.</li>
    <li>Which solutions could be implemented to facilitate greater success?</li>

<h2 id="section-heading-h3">Checklist</h2>
    <li>Consider which methodologies are best suited to your particular need.</li>
    <li>Consider how those methodologies can be modified to better meet your need.</li>
    <li>Implement modified approaches where applicable. Remember: even innovative processes can be improved upon. That is innovation!</li>
    <li>Consider how these modifications may improve innovative processes for others.</li>
    <li>Take note of previous failures for consideration in designing future innovation.</li>
