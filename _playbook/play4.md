<p class="usa-font-lead">Diversity of backgrounds and thought makes for better overall experience, products and services. To build a culture of collaboration look outside of your team or organization’s silo to deliver your mission, and include them in your process to co-create the future. Also, celebrate the successes as well as the failures.

<h2 id="section-heading-h2">Questions to Ask</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the rules with regards to engaging non-feds in public policy, program and service design?</li>
    <li>Whose feedback are you soliciting in evaluating the efficacy of your work?</li>
    <li>Are you speaking to your leadership? Staff? The “consumer”?</li>
    <li>Is your work producing results for the public, or does it simply look good “on paper?”</li>
    <li>Are you soliciting feedback from a diverse group of individuals? In terms of stature, age, race, ethnicity, religion, and other factors? Differences in perception are critical to identifying areas for improvement.</li>
    <li>How do I manage the conflict that comes with diversity?</li>
    <li>Are you including a diverse group of individuals in the brainstorming and solution processes?</li>
