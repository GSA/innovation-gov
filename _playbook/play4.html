        <h1>Play 4: Build a culture of collaboration, communication, and sharing with partners inside and outside of the government.</h1>
        <p class="usa-font-lead">Diversity of backgrounds and thought makes for better overall experience, products and services. To build a culture of collaboration look outside of your team or organization’s silo to deliver your mission, and include them in your process to co-create the future. Also, celebrate the successes as well as the failures.
          <h2 id="section-heading-h2">Questions to Ask</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the rules with regards to engaging non-feds in public policy, program and service design?</li>
            <li>Whose feedback are you soliciting in evaluating the efficacy of your work?</li>
            <li>Are you speaking to your leadership? Staff? The “consumer”?</li>
            <li>Is your work producing results for the public, or does it simply look good “on paper?”</li>
            <li>Are you soliciting feedback from a diverse group of individuals? In terms of stature, age, race, ethnicity, religion, and other factors? Differences in perception are critical to identifying areas for improvement.</li>
            <li>How do I manage the conflict that comes with diversity?</li>
            <li>Are you including a diverse group of individuals in the brainstorming and solution processes?</li>
            <li>Who is evaluating your work or product?</li>
            <li>How can you learn from external partners?</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="section-heading-h3">Checklist</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Open lines of communication between staff and leadership.</li>
            <li>Contact GSA innovators!</li>
            <li>Open lines of communication with the public.</li>
            <li>Solicit, consider, and implement the feedback and solutions offered by your stakeholders. Move beyond mass emails. Set up telephone conversations and, wherever possible, in-person interviews.</li>
            <li>Include stakeholders in all stages of innovation, from the evaluation of your services to evaluation of the solutions.</li>
            <li>Consider the successes of external partners and ask your stakeholders how your agency can replicate those successes.</li></p>
