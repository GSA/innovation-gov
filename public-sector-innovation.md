<p class="usa-font-lead">Defining Innovation in the public sector is not about bringing what works in other sectors and bringing it over to the public sector and expecting it to work in the same way. In the private sector, what fuels innovation is growth and more market share. In government agencies, mission impact and being good stewards of taxpayer’s money drives innovation. Therefore, incentives to innovate are very different. Underlying both of these incentives is deeper impact and creating innovations that people love and want to keep coming back.</p>


### Defining Innovation

Based on research, public sector innovation is defined in the following way:

> Innovation is a product, program, service, or process that is new, creates value and changes the status quo of government services. To be impactful, innovations must also be scalable, not merely one-off novelties.

> Federal government innovation means delivering a better government for and WITH the People.

Public sector innovation is split between four main categories of innovation, based on how might we as a government:
