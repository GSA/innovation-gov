There was a strong desire among modelers at the FDA to learn about one another and to collaborate outside of their immediate Offices and Divisions. Similarly, there was a need to develop a harmonized FDA voice supporting modeling research and establishing review methods for assessing modeling included in regulatory submissions. The ModSim WG was charted in 2016 and has an organizational structure that is unique among FDA working groups: the ModSim WG facilitates the creation of \"Implementation Teams\" that form around a key cross-cutting issue or deliverable and exist until the goal of the team is met. These teams are formed from the group's general membership, as needed, and are interdisciplinary in nature.","Most undergraduate engineering programs have some type of senior design program or senior capstone project which is a part of an engineering design course. Sponsoring a senior design project can be a useful mechanism to amplify a researcher's scientific/engineering effort directed at a specific challenge and can leverage the students\u2019 creativity and motivation if implemented effectively. This novel program created partnerships with student groups to work on regulatory science projects for their senior design. This interaction advances regulatory science and serves to educate the students in medical product regulation. A document detailing suggestions for best practices was developed to facilitate the sustainability of this program.","Computational modeling and simulation (CM&amp;S) is used to provide regulatory support for drugs and devices. Although there is significant academic CM&amp;S used to develop biologic medical products, there is little regulatory experience with CM&amp;S for this application. I worked with modelers across the agency and biologic product experts at the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research to develop methods for reviewing CM&amp;S for biologic products that combines practices from multiple groups. This effort resulted in a guided regulatory review tool and training materials to help regulators with little to no CM&amp;S expertise to assess the credibility and regulatory utility of CM&amp;S submitted as part of an application to test or market a biologic product.","Successful technology challenges, development, and launch","central hub for managing and promoting innovative polices and processes of HHS; Lean Startup-focused Accelerator program, Venture (growth) program","Space for scientists and teams to collaborate","Iterative test how ideas for NCBI product work","HHS ignite project to facilitate HRSA &amp; innovation","designer turned to government work","cloud based claims system for medicaid program","Approcahing MCH societal issues in new ways (ie challenges to solve problems)","Agile scrum practitioners in team of five for more than two years and 60+ sprints (software, product development)","monthly office hours, change facilitators","Cross-agency teams to develop innovations--feeds into HHS Innovates","re-designing user interface to access summary statistics from survey data","innovative approaches to 3D printing to science and medicine","YALI program","developing an innovation community within state","developing innovation policy","Secretary of state's team responsible for collaboration between state, public, and private sector and civil society, the home of innovation at state!","NaN","programs and approaches","Innovation Lab and iLead","Innovative ways to bring interns into government (vsfs.state.gov)","New technology for secretary's communciation and sounding board","Developing and implementing new methods of internal business processes/process management","Used HCD/Service, design to improce consumer's experience in interacting with complaints process","adopting/defaulting to agile approaches, focus on HCD in delivering information and products, whether online or publications","NaN"],"agencyNum":[5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.5,2.5,12.5,10.0,7.5,2.5,5.0,2.5,2.5,10.0,7.5,7.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.5,0.0,5.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,5.0,5.0,10.0,7.5,5.0,7.5,7.5,5.0,5.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.5,22.5,20.0,7.5,20.0,17.5,15.0,12.5,10.0,7.5,7.5,5.0,5.0,2.5,10.0,7.5,7.5,7.5,7.5,2.5,2.5,5.0,5.0,2.5,25.0,0.0,22.5,15.0,15.0,15.0,20.0,20.0,20.0,17.5,15.0,10.0,10.0,12.5,0.0,0.0,7.5,10.0,10.0,7.5,5.0,2.5,10.0,5.0,10.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,2.5,7.5,5.0,2.5,0.0,0.0,0.0],"dept":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","EOP -
