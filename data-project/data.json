    "description": "Computational modeling and simulation (CM&S) is used to provide regulatory support for drugs and devices. Although there is significant academic CM&S used to develop biologic medical products, there is little regulatory experience with CM&S for this application. I worked with modelers across the agency and biologic product experts at the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research to develop methods for reviewing CM&S for biologic products that combines practices from multiple groups. This effort resulted in a guided regulatory review tool and training materials to help regulators with little to no CM&S expertise to assess the credibility and regulatory utility of CM&S submitted as part of an application to test or market a biologic product."

Sponsoring a senior design project can be a useful mechanism to amplify a researcher's scientific/engineering effort directed at a specific challenge and can leverage the students’ creativity and motivation if implemented effectively. This novel program created partnerships with student groups to work on regulatory science projects for their senior design. This interaction advances regulatory science and serves to educate the students in medical product regulation. A document detailing suggestions for best practices was developed to facilitate the sustainability of this program."

    "description": "The FDA's Modeling and Simulation Working Group (ModSim WG) started as a grassroots movement to coordinate modeling expertise at FDA. There was a strong desire among modelers at the FDA to learn about one another and to collaborate outside of their immediate Offices and Divisions. Similarly, there was a need to develop a harmonized FDA voice supporting modeling research and establishing review methods for assessing modeling included in regulatory submissions. The ModSim WG was charted in 2016 and has an organizational structure that is unique among FDA working groups: the ModSim WG facilitates the creation of \"Implementation Teams\" that form around a key cross-cutting issue or deliverable and exist until the goal of the team is met. These teams are formed from the group's general membership, as needed, and are interdisciplinary in nature."
