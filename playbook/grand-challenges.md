## Purpose and Outcomes

**Purpose:** A Grand Challenge is an ambitious yet achievable goal that solves key problems on a large scale, usually capturing the public’s imagination.

A Grand Challenge issues a call to action, creating a sense of urgency and possibility that engages the many stakeholders needed to accelerate new ways of thinking about the problem and progress towards solving that problem. A pioneering vision, large-scale collaborative effort, and an ambitious, but concrete, target are the defining hallmarks of Grand Challenges:

**Grand vision:**The power of a Grand Challenge comes from a narrative that shifts the collective conversation. Bold language - like [making solar energy as cheap as coal, understanding the human brain](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/10/09/brain-initiative-and-grand-challenge-scholars), or [answering the biggest questions in cancer](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2017-02-10-cancer-research-uk-announces-inaugural-grand-challenge-teams-to-answer-the-biggest-questions-in) , and destroying cancerous tumors while leaving healthy cells untouched – changes the question from “Why would we do that?” to “Why aren’t we doing that?”

**All hands-on deck:** Grand Challenges galvanize public excitement and draw in new communities of solvers. A coordinated, “all-hands-on-deck” approach engages other agencies, foundations, research universities, companies, and citizens. The idea of "[everyone as an asteroid hunter](https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/march/be-an-asteroid-hunter-in-nasas-first-asteroid-grand-challenge-contest-series/)" was a powerful way to involve the public in NASA's work. Framing the call as, “We can’t do this alone, we need you,” drew in motivated citizen scientists and experts.

**Ambitious yet achievable target:**  A Grand Challenge inspires people to come up with new approaches because they know what you are trying to accomplish. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s challenge was to “land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth.” The grand vision to “sequence and map all of the genes” guided the Human Genome Project. These targets let the community of solvers ask “what if,” removing boundaries to innovative solutions.

## Examples
A number of agencies use Grand Challenges:
- The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)’s Cyber Grand Challenge Final Event brought together top security researchers and hackers to identify cybersecurity flaws.
- The Department of Energy’s SunShot Initiative seeks to make solar energy cost competitive with coal by the end of the decade, and NASA’s Asteroid Grand Challenge aims to find and address all asteroid threats to human populations.
- The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Grand Challenges for Development address infant and maternal mortality, health supply chains, clean energy for agriculture, water for agriculture, access to off-grid energy, early grade literacy, and are fighting Ebola, Zika and future threats.
- The Audacious Goals Initiative at National Institute of Health’s National Eye Institute aims to restore eye vision.
