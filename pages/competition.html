  <p class="usa-font-lead">Are you ready for something different?</p>

  <p class="usa-font-lead">Do you want to change and impact the way the government works? Join us this Spring and apply innovative practices to real-world, government-wide problems!</p>

  <p>The Better Government Ambassadors Design Challenge offers participants a free, facilitated, team-based experience for impact, fueled by the principles of Human-Centered Design, Lean Startup, and Agile ways of working. The BGM Challenges are a series of events where Better Government Movement members both learn and use innovative practices to address real cross-agency problems faced by the government. This is a great way to learn about these methodologies for your professional development while also being able to complete your day job (in about 8 hours of work/week).</p>

  <p>This team-based Design Challenge includes introductory workshops and a three-month design challenge that you do above and beyond your daily work (for about 8 hours per week). After the workshops, each team works independently and structures its own approach to researching, prototyping and designing their solution, guided by mentors and coaches. The core activity of the BGM Challenges is the design challenge, which will take place from March through June. At the end of the three months teams will pitch their ideas in front of a panel of judges, and those who successfully complete the Challenges will get a Statement of Accomplishment.</p>

  <p>If selected to be part of this first cohort, you will work on one Cross-Agency Priority Goals or other important government-wide challenges alongside members of the latest classes of the <a href="https://pic.gov/whldp">White House Leadership Development Program Fellows</a> and <a href="https://cfo.gov/cxo-fellows/">CXO Fellows</a>. These two Fellowship tackle complex challenges that span agencies and jurisdictions, that require employees to collaborate and leverage networks on a greater scale than in the past, and work outside organizational boundaries to implement shared policies and services.</p>
