    <p>We believe in the power of storytelling to show what is possible with innovative practices, the challenges that change agents face, and the mindset and attitude shifts that accompany culture change. <br><br>  While we only have three featured innovation labs in this section, we hope to create many more case studies of labs, teams, programs, products, and people who are innovating across the public sector to build a better government. Stay tuned for more case studies and stories.</p>
