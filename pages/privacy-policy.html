      <h1> Privacy Policy </h1>
    <p class="usa-font-lead">Your privacy is very important to us. The Better Government Toolkit doesn’t collect personal information when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information. If you do choose to provide information to us, it is only used to fulfill your request for information and participation. Some challenge competitions require that you provide additional information and competitors are bound by the agency rules and terms.</p>
    <p>We do collect some technical information on the Better Government Toolkit. We explain below how we collect and handle this technical information:</p>
    <h2 id="section-heading-h2">Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you and provide information for which you’ve opted-in (for example, to respond to your questions via email). We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. While you must provide an email address for a response to any incoming questions or comments to the Better Government Toolkit, we recommend that you NOT include any other personal information, especially Social Security numbers.</p>

    <p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Products and Programs will not share or sell any of your personal information with any other organization or government agency except as required by law. Please view <a class="local-link" title="GSA privacy and security notice" href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/116609">GSA’s privacy and security notice</a>.</p>
