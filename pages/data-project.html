                usually implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are adopted at the senior levels of government,
                and assist in decision making. (e.g.: OMB-issued policies or laws enacted to support innovation).</p>

            <p class="usa-font-lead">Ways to formalize how different people collaborate at different times in a system.

            <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Technology</h1>
            <p class="usa-font-lead">Hardware, software, and information system capabilities that support change/spur
