        <h3>Join the Better Government Movement community</h3>
        <p>The Better Government Movement was officially launched with a series of human-centered design workshops in March 2017. Throughout 2017 the Community of Practice will collectively build a toolkit and create strategies to amplify and evangelize innovation across the federal government. Here is our mission:

        <blockquote><p>We transform the way the people of government work together, guided by principles, with realignment of, or new investment in, policies, processes, and technology.</p>
        <p>With a focus on efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability, we’ll create a more responsive and collaborative modern government, speaking directly toward the public’s needs and desires.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Innovation.gov and the Better Government Movement is a crowdsourced, open source movement brought to you by the General Services Administration, and built by hundreds of innovators across the Federal government.</p>

        <p>We're from the government, and we're here to help.</p>
