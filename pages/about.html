        <h1>About Innovation.gov</h1>
        <p class="usa-font-lead">Millions of Federal government employees are facing serious cuts to budgets and are asked to “do more with less”, while also being asked to solve complex problems. There’s pressure from above, from Congress, and from the American people to build a government that is more efficient, effective, and cost-cutting. What’s more, is that the public requires a more responsive, resilient government that meets their needs, when they need it.</p>

        <h2 id="section-heading-h2">You're Not in this Aloen</h2>
        <p>It’s so easy to feel like we’re facing these challenge alone. We must band together to face these challenges head first, and learn from each other to create our own stories and a shared understanding of what it means to do public sector innovation. Once we get on the same page, we can devise strategies about how to develop a modern, responsive government. <br>

        But when we look online for help, we often find articles that aren’t targeted to the public sector. Public sector innovation requires a new kind of mission-oriented thinking and perspective, and this is where Innovation.gov comes in. We’re a website built by government innovators to help build awareness and spread the use of innovation being used in the government. <br>

        We bring you real stories by real people facing innovation challenges. We are building a community around them. Working in innovation and pushing the status quo can be isolating--that’s why Innovation.gov and the Better Government Movement exists. <br>

        We’re creating a safe platform and connection points for our community to tell their stories, connect with others and support what they believe in--and learn something in the process. Innovation.gov is where we’re capturing knowledge we can share--and the Better Government Movement is where we can co-create a better future.
