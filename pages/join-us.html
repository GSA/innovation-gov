      <h2>Community of Practice</h2></a>
      <p>Play, explore, experiment, curiosity, creativity, courage, wonder.  We may not immediately associate these words with government work.  But what if we did?  What if we inspired and educated managers, teams, or federal agencies to lead for creativity and design cultures that support innovation?  How might we collaborate to inspire others to unleash their creativity, solve grand problems, and drive innovative results across the government?  How might we connect business brains with human hearts?</p>
      <p>The Better Government Community of Practice is committed to exploring these questions and bringing passionate people together to build, learn, and share innovative stories, mindsets, and creative techniques concerning the public sector.  We seek to create a more rewarding experience for government employees that leads to a more responsive, efficient, and effective government.  This starts with developing the leaders, space, and culture to bring people together to solve real problems.  Together, letâ€™s build something meaningful.  Something inspiring.  Something innovative.  A Better Government.</p>
