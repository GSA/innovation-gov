<p class="usa-font-lead usa-width-one-whole">Millions of Federal government employees face serious budget cuts and are asked to “do more with less”, while also being asked to solve complex problems. There’s pressure from above, from Congress, and from the American people to build a government that is more efficient, effective, and cost-cutting. What’s more, is the public requires a more responsive, resilient government that meets their needs, when they need it.</p>

<p>It’s so easy to feel like we’re facing these challenge alone--that’s why we’ve created The Better Government Movement. Built upon the idea that culture change requires a movement, not a mandate, we’re building a 21st century government, together. Our community of thousands of innovators learn from each other, share their stories shape a better understanding of what it means to create a better, more modern government through innovation. </p>
