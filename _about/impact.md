<h2>What impact is Innovation.gov + The Better Government Movement making?</h2>

Culture change requires a movement of people working together to create a meaningful future. If we are to change the status quo of government, we can’t just rely on a mandate, but a movement to make the change happen.

We’re mobilizing innovators across government to spur culture change--to discover and understand the right problem before they jump to solutions, and ensure we solve the problems right, unlocking barriers to innovation in the process.

This is the impact that we’ve made since the Better Government Movement’s founding in March 2017:
- Founded Better Government Movement
- Soft launched Innovation.gov and completed usability testing on Alpha site
- Convened more than 1,000 people through 15 co-creation workshops and two design-a-thons
- Built the movement: 100 active participants
- Co-created six principles and 15 reports in four verticals
- Created Community of Practice to learn, share, + build
- Building a network of hundreds of innovation mentors, coaches, facilitators to amplify and evangelize innovation
