<p usa-font-lead> Innovation.gov and The Better Government Movement was built for government innovators everywhere--people who are the “early adopters” who have already begun to adopt innovative methods and the “early majority” who are emerging members who are those who want to innovate, but might not know how. At the end of the day, both of these groups are working on their missions to make government better and they need a better way forward.</p>

Government innovators have three major traits in common:

- **Manage, often with limited time and resources**
  - Oversees an innovative team, program, or center, often with limited time and resources
  - Attempts to do work efficiently and effectively
  - Juggles many priorities and as a result becomes reactive and/or overwhelmed  
- **Explore, experiment, cut red tape**
  - Explore how to fit innovative approaches into their office or agency setting, which is often new to their agency and sometimes for themselves
  - Broaden their skillset without having to know everything that there is to be learned.
  - Not always able to write freely about their work
- **Persuade and share stories**
  - Convince leadership at their agency to adopt innovative approaches
  - Innovate within the legal and policy bounds of their agency
  - Tell effective stories about how innovative goals are accomplished

Innovators heavily depend on their human networks to find their information from their peers or people they've heard might help and cast a wide net to learn from a broad variety of resources. Most innovators work closely with stakeholders within their agency and get inspiration from them.

Through our research we have found that for innovators to do their job more effectively, they need authoritative, sample, and replicable documents on topics such as legal/policy/regulations, operational structures, and how to measure their return on investment that they can reuse and adapt to their agency/organization. They're also looking for a personal, in-person touch to connect  with other people who are doing related work and support for being effective leaders of change.
