1. Setting the right leadership and vision
2. Creating core definitions, knowledge base and understanding the citizen-government journey
3. Teaching and empowering change agents to be catalysts for change within their organizations

<p>The Better Government Movement was officially launched with a series of human-centered design workshops in March 2017. Throughout 2017 the Community of Practice will collectively build a toolkit and create strategies to amplify and evangelize innovation across the federal government.</p>

<p>The people working to implement and advocate for innovation within the Federal government are experienced in research, networking, “bureaucracy hacking”, and figuring out how to get things done with limited resources. We're developing out a product that iteratively figures out how to serve their needs -- not just a standalone toolkit “product”, but a useful web resource combined with community and human interaction, which would grow and iterate over time.</p>
