&quot;Innovations arise when people are given a problem to solve instead of being told to implement a known solution.&quot;

&quot; [Innovation is a Contract Sport](https://ourpublicservice.org/publications/viewcontentdetails.php?id=918).&quot; Partnership for Public Service, February 6, 2016.

### Summary

Purpose and Outcomes

**Purpose:** Innovative acquisitions and procurement methods help the government get the most value of its purchasing and outcomes while spending less on contracting processes.

Acquisitions (also known as &quot;procurement&quot;) is the process by which the U.S. Federal Government acquires goods, services, and property through appropriated (or set aside by Congress) funds. This is one of the key tools the federal government has to get things done. In FY 2016 the US Federal Government spent [$462 billion on contracts](https://www.usaspending.gov/transparency/Pages/OverviewOfAwards.aspx), with more than $86 billion in federal information technology (IT), making it the largest buyer in the world. Nearly $64.5 billion goes to maintaining current systems rather than improving them.

The federal government spends a lot of money on information technology purchases, but doesn&#39;t always receive the full value&#39;s worth of that money. Federal government acquisitions was codified in 1974 with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), a nearly 1,500 page document that was created before modern-day technological advances. Also in the past, federal IT acquisitions have had difficulties because:

- There are a limited number of people in the workforce that understand both IT and procurement, which leads to a detrimental skills gap.
- The &quot;status quo&quot; approach of large, multiyear, waterfall-based, extended requirement gathering, year-long competitions does not move at the same speed as technology.
- Companies with creative solutions to many of the government&#39;s tech problems [find it challenging to do business with the government](https://www.fai.gov/media_library/items/show/23) due to high barriers to entry, lack of customer facing tools, complex acquisition processes, and communication confusion on how to identify the available opportunities.

Because of the reasons above, the acquisitions and procurement community has had to rethink and reframe the practice to make way for more modern ways of meeting the needs of users. New and innovative acquisitions encompass a variety of procurement approaches for both digital services and physical products that reduce risk while delivering required outcomes. These approaches:

- improve the likelihood of on-time or early delivery of contracts,
- increase end user satisfaction, and
- can reduce the total cost of ownership.

Recently there has been fresh perspective and focus on acquisitions or procurement in the digital/IT space mostly because that's where the biggest need is today, however, these principles can be applied to other types of acquisitions.

### Approach

Common features of the innovative acquisition methods profiled here include early and frequent collaboration between acquisition teams and end-users, and the use of agile, iterative, and modular implementation methods. (see
Human Centered Design, Lean and Agile sections) Many innovative contracting models can reduce transaction costs and increase access to innovative contractors while still operating within the limits of existing law and regulation. Here are some new ways of thinking in acquisitions and procurement:

| **Traditional Thinking** | **New Thinking** |
| --- | --- |
| If it's not explicitly allowed, it&#39;s prohibited. | If it&#39;s not explicitly prohibited, it's allowed. |
| Creating a statement of work with requirements (prescriptive rather than descriptive) | Offering a statement of objectives with overall purpose/direction (descriptive rather than prescriptive) |
| Acquisitions professionals manage and lead the process | Acquisitions professionals is one of many team members who are needed to successfully acquire modern products and services |
| Large, monolithic contracts | [Modular contracting](https://modularcontracting.18f.gov/) and agile delivery |
| Too-large Request for Proposals (RFPs) | Just-right RFPs that are short and to the point |
| &quot;Push&quot; methods where products and services are outlined in detail and is funded whether or not the final product meets agency needs | &quot;Demand pull&quot; methods dependent upon user needs to stimulate non-traditional methods and companies to participate, and funded when the needs are met |

As budgetary constraints continue to reduce available resources, it is important to use procurement practices that ensure Federal agencies pay only for successful results, not just best efforts. Existing regulations and authorities permit new and more effective acquisition models and processes, which are currently being tested by and used at many agencies. Many proven practices, some listed in this Toolkit like human-centered design and agile software development, helps to close the gap and help adapt their acquisition policies, processes, and team structures to take advantage of these new and promising ways of working.

As new approaches become available in the government or the commercial marketplace, each agency can consider how to encourage and allow the workforce to test and adopt new and better ways of doing business. Most agencies have Acquisition Innovation Advocates and acquisition labs or similar mechanisms, which was [announced in 2016 by the Office of Management and Budget Office of Federal Procurement Policy Memo](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/acquisition-innovation-labs-and-pilot-for-digital-acquisition-innovation-lab-memorandum.pdf). With the dedicated support of this Advocate or lab, agencies can reframe the problem and produce better results.

# Examples


## Modern Contracting Vehicles

**18F Agile Delivery Services Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)**

In keeping with its mission to transform the way the federal government builds and buys digital services, 18F set out to find a new way of procuring digital services: at the speed of agile development cycles. That means ideally less than four weeks from solicitation to contract kickoff, and from there no more than three months to deliver a working product.

18F partnered with the General Service Administration (GSA) Office of Integrated Technology Services to establish a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) featuring vendors specializing in agile delivery services (e.g., user-centered design, agile software development, DevOps). The Agile Delivery Services BPA (Agile BPA) represents an effort to align acquisition practices with agile delivery practices.

The Agile BPA is different from most other traditional IT services contract vehicles. It uses novel ways to select vendors: the most important thing for them is the ability to ship high-quality working software. They issue task orders — consistent with the TechFAR — that feature shorter time-frames, smaller dollar amounts, and user-centered design principles.

## Push versus Demand Pull Methods

Traditional complex procurement processes discourage small business and non-government innovators like startup companies from participating. This process, called the &quot;push&quot; method, outlines the exact needs up front and all acquisitions/procurements are treated roughly the same despite their demand and based on forecasts which are almost always wrong (see [The Standish Group 2015 Chaos Report](http://www.infoq.com/articles/standish-chaos-2015)). Procurements with this method is usually set aside for traditional government contractors, and provides funds upfront whether or not the final product meets the agency&#39;s needs.

On the other side is the &quot;demand pull&quot; method, which uses actual real-time customer demand to generate the need for the product and the direction of it. This method stimulates innovation and allows smaller businesses and inexperienced government contractors to participate. Demand pull mechanisms offer agencies the ability to discover, prove, and scale novel solutions and more effective outcomes.

There are two distinct categories of demand pull methods: pay for performance and purchase commitments, which are described in the table and examples provided below:

| **Category** | **Demand Pull Mechanism** | **What It Does** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pay for Performance** | Advance market commitments | Creates new markets and commits to long-term pricing for purchases |
| Incentive prizes | Gets citizens involved in solving problems |
| Competitive milestone-based payments | Attracts new solutions to well-defined, multi-component problems |
| Micro-purchase authority | Uses a government purchase card to make small awards for coding challenges |
| **Purchase Commitments** | Challenge-based acquisitions | Breaks the entry barrier for startups and young organizations |
| Non-binding purchase agreements | Collaborates with industry and encourage new solutions, without firmly committing to them |
| Rapid technology prototyping | Tries out new technologies rapidly and inexpensively |
| Staged contracts | Solicits proposals and assesses them quickly |

## Pay for Performance

<!--second-column-->

### Advanced Market Commitment (AMC)

**The Pneumococcal AMC**

The Gates Foundation and governments of Italy, The United Kingdom, Canada, Russia, and Norway promised to purchase vaccines on a per-unit basis for a limited amount of time. In return for that promise and financial support, companies developed a [pneumococcal vaccine](http://www.gavi.org/support/nvs/pneumococcal/) and manufacturers provide it at a reasonable cost to citizens in developing countries. In 2015 the target was 1 year ahead of schedule, and by 2016 an estimated 109 million children had been immunized against the disease.

### Incentive Prizes

**New York City Big Apps Challenge**

In 2012, NYC launched the Big Apps Challenge which sought innovative software applications that made municipal data more accessible to city residents. Designers tapped into the developer community to access external expertise. They considered many challenges to help set the $50,000 purse. Designers broke the challenge into 10 topics (for example, green, health and safety, and mobility) and posted clear requirements for each category. They included commercial benefits, inviting investors such as BMW to help judge the challenge. Finally, New York City included an &quot;Investor&#39;s Choice Winner&quot; and allowed the grand prizewinner to demo the app at the New York Tech Meetup. The Big Apps Challenge spurred the development of 96 apps using municipal data in new and innovative ways.

**The Ansari X Prize**

Until October 4, 2004, space flight was the exclusive purview of government. The possibility of space tourism was considered too dangerous and too expensive for the general public and space exploration for the private sector was neither possible nor affordable. [The Ansari XPRIZE](https://ansari.xprize.org/) leveraged investment in a brand new industry. Over the course of the competition, 26 teams invested more than $100 million in aggregate for research and development in suborbital space flight.  In 2004 the Ansari Foundation awarded a $10 million prize to Scaled Composites&#39; Tier One Project for developing a reliable, reusable manned spacecraft.  Among other participants, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic continue to develop private space travel (2018 is the projected date for first trips) and payload delivery. Breakthroughs made as a result of this successful competition led to a private space industry worth more than $2 billion today.

## Purchase Commitments

### Challenge-Based Acquisition

**Department of Defense (DOD)** [**Robotic Rodeo**](https://www.army.mil/article/135279/jieddo_holds_competition_for_new_counter_ied_systems.)

The key difference between challenge-based acquisition and a traditional performance-based acquisition is the requirement to demonstrate product performance in real-world conditions an agency commits resources for full production. Payment is made only after a successful solution is shown.

Twenty-six companies participated in a two-week robotics competition in 2012 held by the DOD at Fort Benning. Four different events tested innovative technical solutions for surveillance and inspection of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) in real-world conditions. A follow-up competition in 2014 choose those who would participate in the next phase of the $49.5 million contract.

### Micro-Purchase Award

**[18F Micro-Purchase](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/)Agreement Experiment**

An 18F Micro-purchase is [an experiment in federal acquisition](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/13/open-source-micropurchasing/), which makes it easier for individuals and businesses, or &quot;vendors,&quot; to leverage their technical expertise toward building the open source software that powers federal agencies — and vice versa.

Conceptually, the platform is simple: 18F Micro-purchase functions as a reverse auction house. Federal agencies work with 18F to create auctions which start at $3,500 or less (this is the ceiling of the federal government&#39;s micro-purchase authority, the authority from which we draw our name). Vendors, for their part, evaluate auctions, review any source code associated with that auction, and place their bids. At the end of each auction, winners deliver their work in accordance with policy and 18F remits payment.

Anyone can participate in this work. Vendors need only have GitHub and System for Award Management (SAM.gov) accounts to sign up and place a bid. If you work in government and are interested in running auctions for an open-source project, [read the getting started guide](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/docs/getting_started.html). Members at 18F are available to scope features, develop an auction strategy, and run your auctions. Although many auctions ask for code, this process can be applied to any kind of contribution to an open source project, including design, content, etc. This experiment will also soon be extended to auctions with starting prices of $25,000 or less.

### Non-Binding Purchase Agreement

**The Department of Energy (DOE) Purchase Challenge**

The DOE created a coalition of more than 200 major commercial building partners and issued a challenge to U.S. manufacturers: &quot;If you can build wireless sub-meters that cost less than $100 apiece and enable us to identify opportunities to save money by saving energy, we will buy them.&quot;

At least 18 manufacturers have responded and its private sector partners that have signed letters of intent to purchase the wireless sub-meters since [DOE issued the challenge in 2013](https://energy.gov/articles/federal-and-industry-partners-issue-challenge-manufacturers). U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz described this activity as &quot;a perfect example of how government can team up with industry to identify a problem and promote the innovation needed to solve it.&quot;

### Rapid Technology Prototyping

**Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)** [**Fast Track Robotics**](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2015-05-18)

The recent explosion in robotics comes from small businesses and individuals in maker and hacker spaces and incubators of low-cost innovation and collaboration. DARPA partnered with Virginia-base hacker space TechShop to streamline the contracting process to address non-traditional performers&#39; needs while still meeting all requirements under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). DARPA supported the rapid development of new robotics capabilities designed to respond to, and even anticipate, quickly evolving warfighter needs with an average cost of $150,000 and simple contracts lasting 6-12 months. The contracting process itself, from the time a proposal is submitted (via a website) to when a contract is signed, took less than a month.

# Actions and Considerations

According to The Standish Group, small IT projects have more than a 70% chance of success while a large project has virtually no chance of coming in on time, on budget, and within scope. For this reason and for others discussed in this overview, it&#39;s important to rethink and reshape how we as the government builds and buys products and services.

Below are some known pitfalls identified during the [Digital Acquisitions Accelerator](https://digitalaccelerator.18f.gov/) in 2016. These are all things that haven&#39;t worked well for us when it comes down to digital acquisitions and you would be better off to avoid them (or at least use them carefully).

Avoiding these common pitfalls is the first steps in transforming acquisitions at your agency.

## Pitfall #1: Large, monolithic contracts

These, simply put, often do not work well for digital products and services. [The Standish Group](http://www.infoq.com/articles/standish-chaos-2015) points out that you&#39;re only giving yourself a six percent chance of success when you start these types of projects. Also, technology moves fast, and if you want your agency to be able to respond quickly in an ever-changing landscape, you&#39;ll need to avoid this at all costs.

## Pitfall #2: Writing too-large RFPs

In 1907, the U.S. Army wanted to acquire an airplane, mind you that airplanes were so cutting edge at the time that they weren&#39;t even called airplanes, they were called &quot;heavier than air flying machines.&quot; Guess how many pages the solicitation was for this piece of technology? 50? 20? No, it was 2 pages! You don&#39;t need 100-page RFPs to acquire the best digital solutions for your agency. Often, all this does is encourage some of your best potential vendors to not respond. The length of these types of RFPs are typically driven by the old requirements-gathering mindset combined with bloated legalese where the concern is more about oversight and liability than product quality and project success. These long RFPs take too much time for your agency to write, too much time from vendors to respond to, and discourage good vendors from bidding. There are very few good outcomes when this happens. Instead, work internally to develop a sound problem statement and product vision. Think in terms of objectives and user stories. Indeed, modern agile development methods pay careful attention to alternative ways of specifying and achieving desired outcomes for product development.

## Pitfall #3: Only having &quot;acquisitions&quot; people involved in the acquisitions process

Acquisitions is more than just buying, and it&#39;s important to bring key expertise, like policy, law, engineering, design, and security, to the table early in the acquisitions process to ensure a project&#39;s success. Leveraging the expertise of a cross-functional team will help make sure your agency is solving the problems for your end users.

## Pitfall #4: Not being open to change

The world moves fast and technology moves even faster. You have to be willing to adapt, course correct, and try new things to get the best digital products and services for your teams. The goal is to get better outcomes, not just contracts. No matter what your experience has been until now, you can learn and apply new techniques to make acquisitions more effective, more efficient and hopefully more joyful (yes, joyful… more on this later). Being open to change means shifting the focus from a &quot;no we can&#39;t&quot; to a &quot;how might we&quot; context. It allows you to solve the problems as they arrive based on any given context, known or unknown.

## Pitfall #5: Forgetting that people, not contracts, manage projects

It&#39;s important to have a product owner that works with the vendor until the period of performance is complete. Often, a contracting officer may work really hard to be sure that every possible clause that may or may not be needed is included within the contract. This is fine, but it often overlooks the reality that over the life of the contract, new ideas will be formed and business strategy may shift. So it&#39;s important to have someone from your agency working hand in hand with the vendor to help make rapid decisions that still align with organizational goals. Relying too heavily on contract clauses to solve every problem that may arise over the period of performance is an untenable expectation. It&#39;s important that you&#39;re allotting time for a resource in your agency to be a product owner to ensure the outcome has a greater chance of success.

According to The Standish Group, small IT projects have more than a 70% chance of success while a large project has virtually no chance of coming in on time, on budget, and within scope. For this reason and for others discussed in this overview, it's important to rethink and reshape how we as the government builds and buys our products.

Now that you are aware of the common pitfalls, the following steps will help you to rethink your acquisition processes for the future:

1. Contact and consult with your agency&#39;s advocate for innovative acquisition. They are there to help you
2. Use &quot;demand pull&quot; mechanisms as described in this overview
3. Think big, and act small
  1. Break large projects into small, discrete components with clearly defined objectives
  2. Simplify the contract or use a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to get started
  3. Establish constraints on time, money, complexity, and size
  4. Add a &quot;kill switch&quot; so contract ends when objectives cannot be met
4. Track results against metrics established by Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
5. Share results in the Innovation Hallway of [GSA&#39;s Acquisition Gateway](https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov/login-information?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhallways.cap.gsa.gov%2Fapp%2F%3Futm_source%3Dgsaag%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dgsacapstie%2520%23%2F)
6. Participate in the Acquisition Innovation Advocates Council that meets regularly with OMB and 18F Consulting to broaden awareness and cross-agency collaboration

# Policies

Innovative contracting approaches are allowed under existing law. New regulations are not needed to deploy any of these authorities:

- [Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR)](https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/pdf/FAR.pdf): Provides a variety of pathways that allow agencies to reshape existing processes to reduce transaction costs while still operating within the confines of existing law and regulation.
- [Other Transactions Authority (OTA)](http://www.transform.af.mil/Projects/Other-Transaction-Authority/): Funding mechanisms which target non-traditional sources and allow a high degree of flexibility in how the agreement is awarded.
- [American Innovation and Competitiveness Act 2016](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3084)
  - Act expands the use of challenges and gives the authority for any federal government agency to work cooperatively with and pool funds from multiple government agencies and profit or nonprofit private sector entity, State, tribal, local or foreign government agencies and higher education institutions.
- [America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2010](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ358/html/PLAW-111publ358.htm)
  - Established authorities for all Federal agencies to offer incentive prizes and run challenge competitions &quot;to stimulate innovation that has the potential to advance the mission of the respective agency.&quot;
