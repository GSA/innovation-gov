# Hiring a Chief Innovation Officer

> "[Chief Innovation Officers] look across the board and figure out how to do things better, faster, and tie those activities into the overall management structure."
> -Bryan Sivak, former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Health and Human Services (HHS)

(quoted in J. Stinson, “Chief Innovation Officers: Do They Deliver?” Stateline, February 6, 2015, http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2015/2/06/chief-innovation-officers-do-they-deliver.)

## Purpose & Outcomes
**Purpose:** Federal agencies can substantially benefit from having a Chief Innovation Officer (CINO) to serve as a catalyst for change to confront emerging challenges or improve the efficiency of decades-old service delivery processes. 

A CINO serves as a beacon for innovation, working to harness, foster, execute, and manage innovative ideas. CINOs are force multipliers: these innovators teach and enable others, and spotlight staff doing or wanting to do innovative work. The role is also inherently flexible and sometimes includes ambiguous boundaries. A CINO’s portfolio may be defined around an agency’s priority needs. 

In broad terms, CINOs:
- Connect people and break down silos to tap into employee ideas in innovative ways;
- Reframe problems in order to change thinking patterns;
- Celebrate and encourage employee engagement in innovative work within an agency;
- Lead agency-wide initiatives to change core underlying processes, improve performance, and increase efficiency; and
- “De-risk” innovation, guiding employees through the transition between old and new processes.”

Appointing a CINO can result in persistent, high-value benefits for agency leadership because the CINO’s top priority is to focus on innovation and relentlessly drive it forward. These efforts can amplify any senior leadership’s capacity for attaining an agency’s mission. In times of tight budgets, CINOs act as change agents to transform an agency’s operations. 

## Examples
- Bryan Sivak launched several new programs that sit within HHS IDEA Lab including the [HHS Ignite Accelerator](https://www.hhs.gov/idealab/ignite-accelerator/) and the [Entrepreneur-in-Residence](https://www.hhs.gov/idealab/eir-program/) program, which brings external talent into HHS for a tour-of-duty.
- For Chris Gerdes, just getting staff talking about and appreciating new approaches has been a significant step in shifting the [Department of Transportation (DOT)](https://www.transportation.gov/) culture – and approaches that may seem trivial can have big impacts. For example, Gerdes began carving out a few minutes in the senior leaders’ weekly agency meeting to spotlight staff doing innovative work. When Monday morning meetings began acknowledging and celebrating that new approaches were important and were succeeding, he received very positive feedback (Source: Interview with Chris Gerdes by Policy Design Lab, July 1, 2016).
- Having a separate innovation team like the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) [Global Development Lab](https://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab) generates critical mass, bringing together best practices, and helping to evangelize innovation across the organization. “It’s much harder,” former CINO Ann Mei Chang observed, “When people are trying to work in isolation to push the boulder up a hill rather than having a team and space to innovate together.” (Source: In-person interview, July 7, 2016).
- Matthew Dunne helped guide the [The Quiet Clean Energy Innovation Revolution at the Department of Energy](http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewstepp/2013/01/07/the-quiet-clean-energy-innovation-revolution-at-the-department-of-energy). He found Senior Executive Service (SES) employees support vital when they authorize the employees they manage to invest time in innovative activities, such as participation in communities of practice (CoP) (Source: Phone interview, July 18, 2016).



# Approach
When establishing a CINO position, federal government agencies may wish to consider various ways to define the position’s role and methods to identify and source candidates. CINOs are not cookie-cutter positions. They can play a combination of multiple roles within their agencies, including that of teacher, manager, advocate, and evaluator.

(1)	Teacher: A CINO’s role includes weaving innovation into an organization’s cultural fabric. CINOs provide individuals in their organization the skillsets necessary to foster and manage innovation on a small scale.
(2)	Manager: CINOs must oversee and support the execution of creative initiatives, which usually involves supervising the steps taken as an idea is implemented as well as providing resources to ensure that the innovation is successful.
(3)	Advocate: CINOs can help bolster innovation by acting as a vocal proponent for creative ideas and innovators who might otherwise become discouraged by negative reaction from superiors.
(4)	Evaluator: CINOs are visionaries who help evaluate new ideas and determine their feasibility and potential impact.

Defining the CINO’s role is critical. Once it is defined, an agency can better determine the job description, and which characteristics are most important in hiring candidates. Several points that agencies may wish to consider when defining the CINO role include:

- **Clarify vision.** Start out by asking yourself, why have you decided to hire someone for this role? What are the goals you are trying to achieve? Are you willing to commit to making this a fundamentally important role in your agency? Taking the time to articulate these answers is an essential clarification exercise. If appointments are just a “checkbox” decision without a thoughtful direction in mind, then the outcomes are likely to be ineffective.   
- **Establish clear goals.** At the outset, clearly scope the CINO role, its expectations, and the measurements of success. Consider working collaboratively with your incoming CINO to fully articulate their job description.
- **Remain flexible.** An inherent amount of flexibility is essential. Thomas Wedell-Wedellsborg stated in [What It Really Means to be an Innovation Officer](https://hbr.org/2014/12/what-it-really-means-to-be-a-chief-innovation-officer), “By now, it is widely recognized that if you are developing a new idea, you have to stay flexible in the beginning and be ready to deviate from the original plan. What fewer people realize is that this is equally true when you establish innovation units. Marry yourself too firmly to a specific setup, model, or metric at the outset, and trouble will soon ensue.” (Source: Thomas Wedell-Wedellsborg, “[What it Really Means to be a Chief Innovation Officer](https://hbr.org/2014/12/what-it-really-means-to-be-a-chief-innovation-officer),” Harvard Business Review, December 5, 2014). In a spirit of continuous learning, agency leadership may consider how to re-visit and re-evaluate the job responsibilities assigned to the CINO. Bryan Sivak adds, “Innovation itself should be an iterative process -- so why shouldn’t the job as well?” (Email correspondence, November 6, 2016)

A sample CINO Job Description is provided by Chris Gerdes (Email correspondence, November 2, 2016):
The CINO shall serve as the chief facilitator of innovation, looking across and outside of the department for opportunities and assisting senior leadership in obtaining the tools and connections necessary to successfully move those opportunities forward. The CINO will assist in training and educating employees on how to support innovation and create processes that encourage employees to turn their ideas into a prototype that may be tested and evaluated for broader adoption. He shall serve as a liaison between bottom-up innovation from those closest to the challenges and top-down innovation at the strategic level. Specific duties include:

- Assisting [the department] in establishing a culture of innovation through the development and implementation of tools, training and processes
- Identifying and, with the support of the secretary, deputy secretary and [other relevant top senior leadership], removing barriers to innovation across the department while creating mechanisms for department staff to prototype and develop their ideas; and
- Identifying potential innovation that could aid the department’s mission and mobilize resources of the federal government to support its development.

In all cases, agencies must have a clear understanding of a CINO’s mission, role, and authority within an agency, in order to attract the most qualified candidates and to enable them to succeed. Sometimes it may be more appropriate to promote operational innovation by designating an innovation “home” in key functional roles such as human resources (HR), legal, and acquisition.

In other contexts where the top priorities involve technology integration and deployment, a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) may also be a suitable leadership home for an innovation portfolio. Some agencies designate their Chief Information Officer (CIO) as the lead for identifying and implementing innovative activities. 
 

## Actions and Considerations
The choice of an appropriate avenue for hiring a CINO depends on agency-specific hiring flexibilities. Agencies may consider bringing in CINOs as either a temporary or permanent hire. Federal employees may wish to consult with their agencies’ human resources office for agency-specific guidance.

- Temporary hires are those brought in for specific duties and responsibilities on short-term detail assignments. A temporary detail can last from 60 days to multiple years. Another avenue to bring in CINOs and CTOs temporarily has been the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA), which allows personnel to be recruited to serve in a temporary position from other federal agencies, state and local governments, colleges and universities, Indian tribal governments, federally funded research and development centers (e.g., DOE’s national laboratories), and other eligible organizations (Title 5 CFR Part 334—Temporary Assignments Under the IPA).
- Permanent hires can be brought in through Special Appointing Authorities. For instance, some agencies have authorities that enable direct hiring of a limited number of scientific, engineering, professional, or administrative personnel without many of the usual requirements and restrictions that can belabor the hiring process. Such authorities can enable agencies to recruit and hire more quickly than possible through typical government means. Permanent hire CINOs could also be sourced from the Senior Executive Service or Candidate Development Programs. In addition, agencies could post a job announcement on USAJobs.gov.

An agency’s implementation of the CINO position can include several mechanisms to help the CINO quickly understand the agency’s challenges and context, thereby shortening the learning curve. Below are some lessons learned from implementing CINOS roles and ways agency leadership facilitated their success.

- Role Definition Connected to the Mission: In creating a CINO role, senior leaders have connected the position, its responsibilities, and authority to execute on ideas with the context of the priorities related to accomplishing the agency’s mission. 
- CINOs Embedded at the Top: The flexibility inherent to creating a CINO position allows agencies to tailor the position to specific contexts. However, CINOs themselves emphasize the importance of embedding the position at the top of the organizational for the person to be effective. 
- Institutionalizing Innovation: Successfully building a culture of innovation within a department or agency remains one of the main challenges for CINOs.The position of CINO cannot be created and then abandoned to succeed on its own; a lesson learned from past CINOs is that support is needed from the top of the organization to help institutionalize innovation as a process and practice. 
- Guidance Within and External to the Agency: Pairing the CINO with an internal agency “buddy” may be particularly helpful if bringing in a non-federal candidate to lead the agency’s innovation portfolio. The “buddy” can be another senior leader, such as a member of the Senior Executive Service, who helps the CINO navigate the learning curve of understanding inefficiencies and opportunities to arrive at solutions within the agency.

## Pay Authorities
Examples of authorities designed to increase pay in certain circumstances include:
- Critical Position Pay Authority (CPPA)—governed by 5 U.S.C. Section 5377 and 5 CFR Part 535—allows federal agencies to the ability to fix the pay of exceptionally well-qualified individuals in critical positions at a rate higher than would be otherwise payable. (OPM.gov, “Pay & Leave: Pay Administration,” Fact Sheet: Critical Position Pay, 2017, https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/critical-position-pay)  A 2014 report by the IDA Science and Technology Policy Institute found that the CPPA was an underutilized flexibility. (IDA Science and Technology Policy Institute, History of the Critical Position Pay Authority and Options to Support Its Use, IDA Document D-5159, March 2014, https://www.ida.org/idamedia/Corporate/Files/Publications/STPIPubs/2014/ida-d-5159.ashx.)
- Scientific and Professional (ST) positions—(governed by 5 U.S.C. Section 3014 and 5 CFR Part 534 Subpart E—allow federal agencies to set and adjust the pay of employees under a pay-for-performance system. (OPM.gov, “Senior Executive Service: Scientific & Senior Level Positions,” Senior Level (SL) Positions, 2017, https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/scientific-senior-level-positions)

## Term Appointments
Examples of hiring authorities with term-limited appointments include: 
- Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Mobility Program—governed by 5 U.S.C. Sections 3371 through 3375 and 5 CFR Part 334—allows federal agencies to temporarily hire skills personnel from state and local governments, institutions of higher education, Indian tribal governments, and other eligible organizations. (OPM.gov, “Hiring Information: Intergovernment Personnel Act,” Overview, 2017, https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act) IPA is a powerful but commonly misunderstood policy. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) encourages agencies to [re-think the following IPA myths and misconceptions](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/intergovernment-personnel-act/).
- Senior Executive Service (SES) authority—governed by 42 U.S.C. Section 1863(g) and 5 U.S.C. Sections 3131 through 3152—allows federal agencies to appoint individuals into positions for up to 3 years with the ability to non-competitively convert the position into a permanent position.

Further information on federal authorities related to term appointments can be found in a 2014 report by the IDA Science and Technology Policy Institute, Federal Term Appointment Hiring Authorities for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Personnel, IDA Document D-5148, April 2014, Table 1, p. 10, https://www.ida.org/idamedia/Corporate/Files/Publications/STPIPubs/2014/ida-d-5148.ashx.

## Expedited Hiring Authorities
Examples of authorities to expedite hiring include:
- Direct hire authority—governed by 5 U.S.C. Section 3304 and 5 CFR Part 337, Subpart B—allows federal agencies to appoint candidates into positions without regard to 5 U.S.C Section 3309 through 3318. (OPM.gov, “Hiring Information: Direct Hire Authority,” Governmentwide Authority, 2017, https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/direct-hire-authority/#url=Governmentwide-Authority) Government-wide direct-hire authorities include those for information technology management and acquisition positions, among others.
- Veterans excepted service authority—governed by Schedule A, 5 CFR Part 213.3102(u)—allows federal agencies to non-competitively hire disabled persons. (OPM.gov, “Disability Employment: Hiring,” Schedule A Hiring Authority, 2017, https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/disability-employment/hiring/#url=Schedule-A-Hiring-Authority)
