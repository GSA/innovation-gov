## Communications
The vast majority of information about the BGM Design Challenge will be communicated via a Google Group and Google-related documents for Design Challenge participants. Exact event locations, dates, and times will be posted there. Group communications, such as introductions, challenge information, and teaming discussions will also occur on that site. When you sign up for the Design Challenge you will receive an invite for the Google Group and that's where all communications will be housed.

## Fees

The Design Challenge is provided free of charge for participants, however there is a time commitment. By participating in this Design Challenge and receive your Statement of Accomplishment you're signing up to fully participate in the full length of the Design Challenge.
