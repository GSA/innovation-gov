## Communications
The vast majority of information about the BGM Competition will be communicated via a Google Group and Google-related documents for Competition participants. Exact event locations, dates, and times will be posted there. Group communications, such as introductions, challenge information, and teaming discussions will also occur on that site. When you sign up for the Competition you will receive an invite for the Google Group and that's where all communications will be housed.

## Fees

The Competition is provided free of charge for participants, and the commitment is a time commitment. By participating in this Competition and receive your Statement of Accomplishment you're signing up to fully participate in the full length of the Competition.
