We’re bringing the best talent together to make this really sing, and I’m asking each of you to help give back to the community. We’re looking for really great people to be mentors, coaches, trainers and facilitators for our first cohort.

Our first cohort begins on March 23 and will continue until June 14th, with a mixture of in person and virtual meetings in and around Washington, DC. You are not required to attend all the sessions, and if you sign up to participate we expect that you come through on your commitment. You can sign up for more than one role, depending on your availability. When selected We’ll be in touch in early March with more details.

# What’s Involved
#### Trainers
Subject matter experts versed in the technical know-how and teach three hour workshops on the following trainings:
* Problem Scoping
* Human-Centered Design and/or Design Thinking
* Lean Startup
* Agile Project Management
* Change Management
* Prototyping
* Pitching + Pitch Decks

We’re doing a [flipped classroom approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), which participants be doing much of the learning about the topic outside of the classroom, and doing practical exercises inside workshops. We’re relying on EXISTING approaches rather than recreating the wheel.

**Time Commitment + Expectations:** 1 Workshop (with pre work), 20 hours of work total. Attend 30-minute orientation about the program; Create pre work worksheet (with videos, articles, and/or reflection activities) for cohort prior to course; Lead a 3-hour practical workshop on a Thursday evening

#### Mentor/Sherpa
Confidant and advisor who guide teams to success along the three months. You don’t need to have expertise in all the areas that are listed to be a successful mentor or sherpa, but have a real willingness to help and usher the teams to success.

**Time Commitment + Expectations:** 4-6 hours per month, 12-18 hours total. Attend a 30-minute orientation to the program; Meet with teams once every other week for 30 minutes; for one hour halfway through; be responsive to the teams as they need it.

#### Facilitator
Neutral conveners with the ability to move groups in discussion, problem identification, and solutioning. We have two needs for facilitators: co-facilitators for the workshops and facilitators on call. People who want to be facilitators do not need deep expertise in a specific area of focus (e.g. Human-Centered Design, Change Management), but have awareness of these methods. Facilitators on call will be notified should a team get “stuck” in a particular area.

**Time Commitment + Expectations:** 4-6 hours per month, 12-18 hours total. Attend a 30-minute orientation to the program; Work with lead trainer for prep and facilitation day-of workshop; be responsive to the teams as they need it.

#### Coach
Professional coaches use a range of communication skills (such as targeted restatements, listening, questioning, clarifying etc.) to help teams shift their perspectives and discover different approaches to achieve their goals.

**Time Commitment + Expectations:** 4-6 hours per month, 12-18 hours total. Attend a 30-minute orientation to the program; Meet with teams once every other week for 30 minutes; for one hour halfway through; be responsive to the teams as they need it.
