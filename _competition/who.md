The ideal Challenge participant is a Federal government employee who is seeking a unique experience to experiment, collaborate, and share a creative experience with others. Participants are committed to the process, eager to learn and practice these innovative practices (regardless of pre-existing knowledge and experience), and are passionate souls and a team players.

By signing up for the BGM Design Challenge, you confirm that you: 1) are committing to participating in all 12-weeks of the program and 2) have approval from your supervisor to participate and 3) commit to attending at least 8 out of 9 required workshops (see Schedule and Time Commitment section).

If selected, we will place you on a team of 4-6 people based on your preferences and background and you all will tackle the problem together over the course of three months (12 weeks). Team success is heavily dependent upon the commitment and collaboration between the teams, so weâ€™re looking for serious members to sign up for this Design Challenge.
