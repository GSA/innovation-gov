# About this Project

The Better Government Movement seeks to answer this question: how might we effectively serve the many talented Federal employees who have the motivation and potential to cause change?

Since the movement launched in March, we’ve convened more than 1,000 people across the government to envision a modern government. Through crowdsourcing, we’ve defined what we mean by better government, what is stopping us from innovating, and have created a series of six plays to guide innovation across the government. Soon, we'll launch or initial findings on Innovation.gov and will expand to expand to a Toolkit later in 2017.


# We Want Your Feedback
We encourage your feedback and suggestions on these documents. Content and feature suggestions and discussions are welcome via GitHub Issues. You may also propose changes to the content directly by submitting a pull request.

You don't need to install any software to suggest a change. To propose a change from your browser, select a play in the _plays folder. You can use GitHub's in-browser editor to edit files and submit a "pull request" for your changes to be merged into the document.

If you would like to see and discuss the changes that other people have proposed, visit the "Pull Requests" section and browse the issues.

## Technical Details
The site is compiled from Markdown files using Jekyll. To propose a specific change, you can submit a pull request with your change to one of these source Markdown files. The bulk of the content is in the _toolkit _playbook and _stories folders.

You can also use Github's in-browser editing feature to make an edit to one of these Markdown files and submit your change for consideration without needing to install any additional software.

## Running the Site Locally
To run the site locally on your own computer (most helpful for previewing your own changes), you will need to install Jekyll and other dependencies:

If you don't already have Ruby and Bundler installed, follow the first two steps in these Jekyll installation instructions.
1. Next, fork this repository and clone it on your computer.
2. Navigate to the folder on your computer, and run the command bundle install at the command line prompt.

To run the site locally, run jekyll serve --watch, then visit http://localhost:4000/ in your browser to preview the site.

## Editing the Stylesheets
This project uses Sass for managing its style sheets. These styles are defined in the styles.scss file. We use Jekyll's native SASS support to auto-generate the required CSS when you run the site locally, as described above.
