**Insights**

- Changing mindsets and skillsets
- &quot;This is a doorway&quot; – know the language
- Commenting and engagement, curated and push
- Those coming in to public sector don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be a designer in government

- Tension  - team vs. individual
- Rebel Talent
- Potential for impact often does not correlate with titles
- &quot;Network of Innovators&quot; – built bg gov lab (NYU)
- PRA must be clarified improved before this launches (AM)
- COP- Ambassadors could have overlap
- COP – PDL (Learning Leadership, Pragmatic, Inspiration, Heart-Mind)
- Network (Ambassadors, CoP)
- Behavior    Mindset / Culture
- Grow together
- Thriving ecosystem
- The lab at OPM has built and matured (GSA, VA) partnership that could be good &quot;test bed&quot; (AM)
  - What works here? (Them vs. Us)

**Where does the Toolkit fit in?**

- Primer on what you need to know about the policies, processes and provide access to more details available
- A how-to guide on how to do innovation within your agency
- Success stories and places where innovation has been effective effective
- Highlight failures from Agencies
- Post information to put into practice

**Lessons Learned/Observations/Challenges**

- People needed a community over a toolkit
- Be cautious to message the Toolkit as &quot;the thing&quot; rather than a component of the ecosystem
- The toolkit gives common language  - validated set of things to get started—but need the support of the community
- A toolkit provides a false set of expertise -- if you stay at that level of tools you miss the mindset change and individual transformation
- We are about education not training
- Metaphor: You have a backpack and some training but need someone to climb the mountain with you
- The toolkit is a doorway, glossary, etc.
- How does this link to a community of practice?
  -
    - Recommendation: Introduce a rich commenting function – have the commenting be parallel to the content
    - The comments should be curated and pushed – it&#39;s not a wiki

- How do we change behavior? Sometimes the behavior follows the mindset.

- Key target audience: A massively large population that is consciously incompetent. This might be the biggest area of impact?

-
  - Where is our biggest area of impact?

- The administration&#39;s rhetoric is misaligned with their execution – internal staff of administration is focused on internal management
- What are we actually doing for people?
  - Creating a world in which the work of government is more rewarding and its actions are responsive and effective
- Process of learned helplessness
- PRA is the number one issue that needs to be solved
- Our actual user experience is the Federal employee (activated) experience
- If people are inspired that provides us with a better more responsive government
- Problem between the people and the system?
- Value in focusing on the employee that doesn&#39;t have a voice
- There are organizations that aren&#39;t really leading
- ** &quot;Inclusion&quot; -** it&#39;s leadership and not management
- Commitments can be categorized as:

- Our commitments, jointly created commitment, joint commitment

**What is possible?**

- Innovation is a given not an exception to the rule – continually happening
- Unshackle organizations and efforts (contracting issues)
- Make jobs easier
- More responsive government
- Create a government that is more:
  - Rewarding – internal
  - Responsive – external
  - Effective – external
