## Better Government Movement (Amy) and Ambassadors Program (Bethany) Updates
The Better Government Movement in full swing: We're on target to launch Innovation.gov in the next month, this week we held a CoP listening session, the Toolkit peer review was launched (out in October), and finally we have a team of three great women who are leading the charge on the Ambassadors Program. We're moving forward with four main verticals: 

1. **Create a 21st century culture and workforce** (Better hiring practices: hiring a Chief Innovation Officer, Tour of Duty hiring; Improve ways that contracting and acquisitions is done; Incentivize people to innovate and overcome barriers to innovation)
2. **Improve government services delivery** (Design user-centered programs, products and services that speak directly to the publicâ€™s needs; Amplify proven innovative disciplines, methods, and tools such as Lean and Agile approaches; Support creation of innovative labs, programs, and services; hire top talent to lead innovation; Encourage data-informed decision making and evidence-based approaches to contribute to your story)
3. **Solve complex societal and governmental problems** (Identify and pursue grand challenges to address national priorities and tackle societal problems; Lessen siloed thinking across government and encourage cross-agency collaboration; Address common government challenges and share expertise; Lead research and design to solve current challenges and to solve the challenges of the future)
4. **Collaborate with innovators outside government** (Harness the creativity of the public through incentivized competitions/challenges; Empower innovators with open and machine-readable Federal data; Launch high-impact multi-sector collaborations)
