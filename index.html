    <h2>Better Government Plays</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="usa-width-two-thirds">
    <p class="usa-font-lead"> The power of the federal government is in the reach and scale of its work. That reach and scale creates opportunities and challenges for innovation. Meeting the innovation imperative within government is not about launching ever-greater numbers of pilot projects that don’t grow. It’s about developing cultural norms and practices that support increased awareness, adoption, and adaptation of successful innovations systematically across the entirety of government.</p>

    <p>The plays listed here were co-created over a series of workshops with more than 1,000 public sector innovators in Spring 2017.</p>
      <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/playbook/">What is Public Sector Innovation?</a></h3>
      <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/playbook/play1/">Play 1: Everyone can and should innovate.</a></h3>
      <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/playbook/play2/">Play 2: Keep the customer at the center of your design.</a></h3>
      <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/playbook/play3/">Play 3: Embrace change. Experiment and seek feedback to make incremental continous improvements and reduce risk.</a></h3>
      <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/playbook/play4/">Play 4: Build a culture of collaboration, communication, and sharing with partners inside and outside the government.</a></h3>
      <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/playbook/play5/">Play 5: Let data inform your decision-making and be a key part of your story.</a></h3>
      <h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/playbook/play6/">Play 6: Innovation is not a one-size-fits-all approach.</a></h3>
