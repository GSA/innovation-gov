        <p>Talented Federal employees working to implement and advocate for innovation within the government are experienced in research, networking, “bureaucracy hacking”, and figuring out how to get things done with limited resources. We're developing out a product that iteratively figures out how to serve their needs -- not just a standalone toolkit “product”, but a useful web resource combined with community and human interaction, which will grow and iterate over time.</p>

          <h2>Join the Better Government Movement</strong></h2>
          <p>The Better Government Movement was officially launched with a series of human-centered design workshops in March 2017. Throughout 2017 the Community of Practice will collectively build a toolkit and create strategies to amplify and evangelize innovation across the federal government. Here is our mission:</p>
          <blockquote><i><p>We transform the way the people of government work together, guided by principles, with realignment of, or new investment in, policies, processes, and technology.<br><br>With a focus on efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability, we’ll create a more responsive and collaborative modern government, speaking directly toward the public’s needs and desires.</i></p></blockquote>
          <p>Innovation.gov and the Better Government Movement is a crowdsourced, open source movement brought to you by the <b>General Services Administration</b>, and built by hundreds of innovators across the Federal government.</p>
        <p>We're from the government, and we're here to help.</p>
