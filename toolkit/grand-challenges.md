## Purpose and Outcomes

**Purpose:** A Grand Challenge is an ambitious yet achievable goal that solves key problems on a large scale, usually capturing the public's imagination.

A Grand Challenge issues a call to action, creating a sense of urgency and possibility that engages the many stakeholders needed to accelerate new ways of thinking about the problem and progress towards solving that problem. A pioneering vision, large-scale collaborative effort, and an ambitious, but concrete, target are the defining hallmarks of Grand Challenges:

- **Grand vision:** The power of a Grand Challenge comes from a narrative that shifts the collective conversation. Bold language - like [making solar energy as cheap as coal](https://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/sunshot-initiative), [understanding the human brain](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/10/09/brain-initiative-and-grand-challenge-scholars), or [answering the biggest questions in cancer](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2017-02-10-cancer-research-uk-announces-inaugural-grand-challenge-teams-to-answer-the-biggest-questions-in), and destroying cancerous tumors while leaving healthy cells untouched – changes the question from &quot;Why would we do that?&quot; to &quot;Why _aren&#39;t_ we doing that?&quot;
- **All hands-on deck:** Grand Challenges galvanize public excitement and draw in new communities of solvers. A coordinated, &quot;all-hands-on-deck&quot; approach engages other agencies, foundations, research universities, companies, and citizens. The idea of &quot; [everyone as an asteroid hunter](https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/march/be-an-asteroid-hunter-in-nasas-first-asteroid-grand-challenge-contest-series/)&quot; was a powerful way to involve the public in NASA&#39;s work. Framing the call as, &quot;We can&#39;t do this alone, we need you,&quot; drew in motivated citizen scientists and experts.
- **Ambitious yet achievable target:**  A Grand Challenge inspires people to come up with new approaches because they know what you are trying to accomplish. The [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)&#39;s challenge](https://www.history.nasa.gov/Apollomon/Apollo.html) was to &quot;land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth.&quot; The grand vision to &quot;sequence and map all of the genes&quot; guided the [Human Genome Project](https://www.genome.gov/12011238/an-overview-of-the-human-genome-project/). These targets let the community of solvers ask &quot;what if,&quot; removing boundaries to innovative solutions.

## Examples

A number of agencies use Grand Challenges:

- The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA's)[Cyber Grand Challenge Final Event](https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-grand-challenge) brought together top security researchers and hackers to identify cybersecurity flaws.
- The Department of Energy's [SunShot Initiative](https://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/sunshot-initiative) seeks to make solar energy cost competitive with coal by the end of the decade, and [NASA's Asteroid Grand Challenge](http://www.nasa.gov/feature/what-is-the-asteroid-grand-challenge) aims to find and address all asteroid threats to human populations.
- The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID's) [Grand Challenges for Development](https://www.usaid.gov/grandchallenges) address infant and maternal mortality, health supply chains, clean energy for agriculture, water for agriculture, access to off-grid energy, early grade literacy, and are fighting Ebola, Zika and future threats.
- The [Audacious Goals Initiative](https://nei.nih.gov/audacious) at National Institute of Health&#39;s National Eye Institute aims to restore eye vision.

## Approach

How might we create Grand Challenges?

There are a variety of Grand Challenge frameworks you can use: An all-in commitment from an agency (like NASA&#39;s space program); engaging matching funds from the private sector; agency announces its commitment framework, and then creates space for others to support it; agency makes a commitment with external partnerships, but the agency does not fund any of the solutions.

An agency&#39;s commitment, the ways they will support the Grand Challenge, is based on a number of reasons including how they can, in a federal context, engage with other organizations–formally or informally–and which approach is most appropriate for the Challenge goal. Here are some questions to consider.

- How much control do we want to maintain?
- Do we want to issue this into the world, and let a 501c3 or organizations take it forward?
- Do we want to formally partner with other organizations to help run this?
- Are we contracting with them, or are we partnering?

At its most basic level a Grand Challenge program has three phases:

### Phase 1: Problem Definition Phase

It is important to invest time and resources in the problem definition process, being open-minded to goal definition and redefinition, and receptive to refining the target based on feedback. Define the problem with expert stakeholder input and meaningful engagement by citizen solvers. They help identify the barriers to problem solving, and assess the landscape to understand what sort of call to action is needed. It takes the right problem, right partners, and right activities to catalyze action and create an opportunity for problem-solving.

### Phase 2: Program Development Phase

Grand Challenge programs have these ingredients:

- High-level support and receptiveness for new approaches give Grand Challenge teams permission to reimagine how they see the problem and who they engage to solve problems.
- The right team of creative thinkers from within the agency who can see beyond what will happen next year, and look at longer time horizons.
- A set timeframe, typically 5 to 10 years, but up to 20 years, with clear measurable targets and easy to track milestones.
- Invest time in breaking the goal into parts so that experts and citizen solvers can contribute in different ways.
- Multi-year planning that aligns with budget cycles, including a plan for implementation, and long-term plans for integrating outcomes from the Challenge.

### Phase 3: Program Implementation Phase

Like other programs, during implementation you will continually refine to keep pace with new learning, and changes in technology and other factors. In a Challenge program, an engagement strategy focused on the community of solvers is an important part of implementation.  There will be events to encourage progress towards the goal, to find what next steps might be, hear about needs, or share accomplishments. You are building a community based on partnership and engagement from every level, from deep technical experts to motivated citizens. If you want to broaden the community base of problem-solvers, you must have a constant drumbeat through activities and communication.

## Actions and Considerations

There is a lot of flexibility in how to set up a Grand Challenge.  Develop the Grand Challenge that works best for your agency by leveraging choices about funding levels, formality, and the division of roles and responsibilities.

- Identify who should be engaged in the early stages of defining the problem.
- Find out how you can use appropriated funds.
- Select a Grand Challenge framework to match your agency&#39;s commitment.
- Get leadership support and build your agency&#39;s Challenge team.
- Set Challenge goals and targets that balance ambition and feasibility.
- Prepare multi-year budgets and plans for program development and implementation.
- Develop targeted messages for each within the community of solvers.

## Policies

- [American Innovation and Competitiveness Act 2016](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3084)
  - Act expands the use of challenges and gives the authority for any federal government agency to work cooperatively with and pool funds from multiple government agencies and profit or nonprofit private sector entity, State, tribal, local or foreign government agencies and higher education institutions.
- [America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education,](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/5116) [and Science (COMPETES) Reauthorization Act of 2010](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/5116)
  - Act passed &quot;to invest in innovation through research and development, and to improve the competitiveness of the United States.&quot; In many places, the Act mandates that each agency cooperate with its partner agencies and offices, and it calls attention to the importance of high-risk, high-reward research in areas of critical national need.
